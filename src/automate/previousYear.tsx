// Q1. India has experienced persistent and high food inflation in the recent past. What could be the
// reasons?
// 1. Due to gradual switch over to the cultivation of commercial crops, the area under the
// cultivation of food grains has steadily decreased in the last five years by about 30%.
// 2. As a consequence of increasing incomes, the consumption patterns of people have undergone
// a significant change.
// 3. The food supply chain has structural constraints.
// Which of the statements given above are correct?
// (a) 1 and 2 only
// (b) 2 and 3 only
// (c) 1 and 3 only
// (d) 1, 2 and 3
// Answer: (b)
// Food inflation is referred to as the persistent rise in the price of agricultural produce for a certain
// period of time. The causes of food inflation are manifold. It may be due to less agricultural production,
// soaring demand for agricultural produce, supply shortages, etc. In the previous decade high food
// inflation was a problem for the country.
// Statement 1 is not correct: With respect to 2011, India has experienced persistent and high food
// inflation and it is due to the fact that the area under food grain cultivation did decrease in the last
// five years. The area under food grain cultivation decreased around 4-5% of the gross cropped area of
// the country. This caused a demand-supply mismatch, which resulted in high food inflation.
// Statement 2 is correct: Due to the liberalization of the economy, the overall economic activity got
// pushed up bringing economic growth to the country in effect increasing the incomes of people. Due
// to these increased incomes, consumption of food grains has also increased, thus increasing the
// demand for the same. The production did not increase at the same pace, due to which food inflation
// did happen frequently.
// Statement 3 is correct: Food supply chain from farm to the plate of the consumers, has got structural
// constraints like lack of warehousing, low farm sorting and grading, lack of cold chain facilities in the
// country etc. These were the major supply side constraints which led to food inflation.
// Q2. In terms of economy, the visit by foreign nationals to witness the XIX Commonwealth Games in
// India amounted to
// (a) Export
// (b) Import
// (c) Production
// (d) Consumption
// Answer: (a)
// Option (a) is correct: In terms of economy, the visit by foreign nationals to witness the XIX
// Commonwealth Games in India amounted to exports.
// ● The hosting of global events brings many foreign nationals into the country. They consume
// varying amounts of goods and services in the domestic territory of India.
// ● To pay for these goods and services in Rupees which they exchange an equivalent amount of
// foreign currency in the country.
// ● This amounts to the export of goods and services from India to foreign nationals, however in
// all possibilities the consumption of these goods and services happens within the territory of
// India.
// Q3. Which one of the following statements appropriately describes the “fiscal stimulus”?
// (a) It is a massive investment by the Government in manufacturing sector to ensure the supply of
// goods to meet demand surge caused by rapid economic growth.
// (b) It is an intense affirmative action of the Government to boost economic activity in the country.
// (c) It is the Government’s intensive action on financial institutions to ensure disbursement of loans
// to agriculture and allied sectors to promote greater food production and contain food inflation.
// (d) It is an extreme affirmative action by the government to pursue its policy of financial inclusion.
// Answer: (b)
// Option (b) is correct: Fiscal Stimulus is the process of infusing money into an economy that is going
// through a crisis. It is an intense affirmative action of the government to boost economic activity in
// the country.
// ● During the economic downturn, the government stepped in with a set of measures to
// reinvigorate the economy. Most often, these involve increased spending by the government
// to increase employment and general demand in the economy, which acts as a signal for
// companies to increase production, which in turn will lead to more hiring and so on through
// the virtuous economic cycle.
// ● Moreover, the government also reduces various types of taxes to increase the money supply
// in the market. It is generally not limited to or specific to a particular sector.
// Q4. Consider the following action which the Government can take:
// 1. Devaluing the domestic currency.
// 2. Reduction in export subsidy.
// 3. Adopting suitable policies which attract greater FDI and more funds from FIIs.
// Which of the following action/actions can help in reducing the Current Account Deficit?
// (a) 1 and 2 only
// (b) 2 and 3 only
// (c) 3 only
// (d) 1 and 3 only
// Answer: (d)
// Current Account Deficit (CAD) is the shortfall between the money received by selling products to
// other countries and the money spent to buy goods and services from other nations. If the value of
// goods and services imported exceeds the value of those exported, the country is said to be in a deficit,
// and the difference in the two values is CAD.
// Statement 1 is correct: Devaluing the domestic currency will make the domestic currency cheaper in
// comparison to foreign currencies which will make Indian goods cheaper in comparison to foreign
// goods, hence increasing the exports of goods and services from the country.
// Statement 2 is not correct: Reduction in export subsidy will make exports from India more expensive
// thus reducing exports and it will lead to an increase in the Current Account deficit of the country.
// Statement 3 is correct: Attracting greater Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Institutional
// Investment (FII) will increase the inflow of foreign exchange in the country. Both these steps will help
// in bridging Current Account Deficit in the country.
// Q5. A rapid increase in the rate of inflation is sometimes attributed to the “base effect”. What is
// “base effect”?
// (a) It is the impact of drastic deficiency in supply due to failure of crops.
// (b) It is the impact of the surge in demand due to rapid economic growth.
// (c) It is the impact of the price levels of previous year on the calculation of inflation rate.
// (d) None of the statements (a), (b) and (c) given above is correct in this context.
// Answer: (c)
// Option (c) is correct: The base effect refers to the impact of the rise in price level (i.e., last year’s
// inflation) in the previous year over the corresponding rise in price levels in the current year (i.e.,
// current inflation).
// ● If the price index had risen at a high rate in the corresponding period of the previous year
// leading to a high inflation rate, some of the potential rises is already factored in, therefore a
// similar absolute increase in the Price index in the current year will lead to a relatively lower
// inflation rate.
// ● On the other hand, if the inflation rate was too low in the corresponding period of the previous
// year, even a relatively smaller rise in the Price Index will arithmetically give a high rate of
// current inflation.
// Q6. India is regarded as a country with a “Demographic Dividend”. This is due to
// (a) Its high population in the age group below 15 years.
// (b) Its high population in the age group of 15-64 years.
// (c) Its high population in the age group above 65 years.
// (d) Its high total population.
// Answer: (b)
// Demographic dividend is understood as the prospective economic growth that can be achieved as a
// result of the changes of the age structure of the population of a country, that is, generally when the
// working population in a nation becomes more than the dependent population.
// Option (b) is correct: India is regarded as a country with high Demographic Dividend as it has a high
// population in the working age group of 15-64 years.
// Additional Information:
// ● Since 2018, India’s working-age population (people between 15 and 64 years of age) has
// grown larger than the dependent population — children aged 14 or below as well as people
// above 65 years of age. This bulge in the working-age population is going to last till 2055, or 37
// years from its beginning.
// Q7. Which one of the following is not a feature of “Value Added Tax”?
// (a) It is a multi-point destination-based system of tax.
// (b) It is a tax levied on value addition at each stage of transaction in the production distribution
// chain.
// (c) It is a tax on the final consumption of goods or services and must ultimately be borne by the
// consumer.
// (d) It is basically a subject of the Central Government, and the State Governments are only a
// facilitator for its successful implementation.
// Answer: (d)
// Value added Tax or VAT was an indirect tax which was levied on goods and services on each point of
// value addition in the production cycle starting from the raw material to the end stage of retail sale. It
// is a multipoint destination-based system of tax, borne by the consumer (not by the seller) on
// consuming final goods and services.
// Statement (d) is not correct: VAT is entirely a subject of the State Government. The VAT system is
// enforced by the State governments (not the Central Government) and the rates of taxation also vary
// from state to state.
// However, The GST subsumed all previous taxes that were levied on the sale of goods or provision of
// services by either Central or State governments.
// Q8. A “closed economy” is an economy in which
// (a) the money supply is fully controlled
// (b) deficit financing takes place
// (c) only exports take place
// (d) neither exports nor imports take place
// Answer: (d)

// investment in a country. Which of the following statements best represents an important difference
// between the two?
// (a) FII helps bring better management skills and technology, while FDI only brings in capital.
// (b) FII helps in increasing capital availability in general, while FDI only targets specific sectors.
// (c) FDI flows only into the secondary market, while FII targets primary market.
// (d) FII is considered to be more stable than FDI.
// Answer: (b)
// Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Institutional Investment (FII) are both channels through
// which foreign capital flows into a country.
// ● Foreign Direct Investment is an investment by a foreign entity into a domestic business with
// the intent of establishing long lasting business interests in that nation with the help of the
// targeted business.
// ● Foreign Institutional Investors are foreign investors which invest in another country through
// various income generating assets like Stocks, Bonds etc. Their primary interests are short term
// to earn higher returns on their investments as compared to their own domestic territories.
// They are more volatile in nature than FDI due to their short term and limited intentions.
// Option (b) is correct: FII helps in increasing the general capital availability in the country as they
// invest large sums of money into varied asset classes across the domestic markets. On the contrary,
// FDI is targeted only at a particular sector and at times only to a particular business entity.

// and keep managerial control in its hands.
// Additional Information:
// ● The government undertakes disinvestment to reduce the fiscal burden on the exchequer or
// to raise money for meeting specific needs, such as to bridge the revenue shortfall from other

// Q18. Economic growth is usually coupled with
// (a) Deflation
// (b) Inflation
// (c) Stagflation
// (d) Hyperinflation
// Answer: (b)
// Option (b) is correct: Economic growth is usually coupled with Inflation, that is the general rise in
// price levels, as inflation makes production more attractive for suppliers, due to higher market prices
// for their produce. This stimulates them to produce more and, in the process, causes economic growth
// due to more production of goods and services in the economy.
// Additional Information:
// ● Deflation: When the overall price level decreases so that inflation rate becomes negative, it
// is called deflation. A reduction in money supply or credit availability is the reason for deflation
// in most cases. Reduced investment spending by the government or individuals may also lead
// to this situation. Deflation leads to a problem of increased unemployment due to slack in
// demand.
// ● Stagflation: Stagflation is a combination of persistent high inflation with high unemployment
// and stagnant demand in a country's economy.
// ● Hyperinflation: It describes rapid, excessive, and out-of-control general price increases in an
// economy. Hyperinflation is when the prices of goods and services rise more than 50% per
// month.
// Q19. The lowering of Bank Rate by the Reserve Bank of India leads to
// (a) More liquidity in the market
// (b) Less liquidity in the market
// (c) No change in the liquidity in the market
// (d) Mobilization of more deposits by commercial banks
// Answer: (a)
// Option (a) is correct: Bank Rate is the rate at which the RBI lends to the commercial banks without
// keeping a collateral. Lowering of the bank rate will make access to borrowed funds cheaper for banks,
// this benefit accruing to them is passed on to the borrower in the economy in the form of lower interest
// rates on further lending by the commercial banks. This increases the credit uptake in the economy
// and thus the money supply and liquidity.
// Polity and Governance
// Q1. What is the difference between “vote-on-account” and “interim budget”?
// 1. The provision of a “vote-on-account” is used by a regular Government, while an “interim

// provision is known as the ‘vote on account’. It is passed (or granted) after the general discussion on
// Budget is over. It is generally granted for two months for an amount equivalent to one-sixth of the
// total estimation. Vote on account is passed every year, used by both the regular and caretaker
// Government.
// Statement 2 is correct: A “Vote-on-account” deals only with expenditure while interim budget both
// revenue and expenditure. An Interim Budget is similar to a Union Budget. In the Interim Budget, the
// ruling Government tables estimates of its expenditure, revenue, fiscal deficit and financial
// performance and projections for the upcoming financial year. The ruling Government at the end of its
// tenure, presents an Interim Budget for three to four months so as to keep the country running

// Nation. Constituted under Article 267(1) of the Indian Constitution, the Contingency Fund of
// India is used at a time when there is a crisis in the nation — a natural calamity, for instance —
// and money is required to deal with it. The Union government has its own contingency fund
// with a corpus of Rs 500 crore. States can also opt to have their own Contingency Funds. The
// Contingency Fund of the Union Government is at the disposal of the President of India, who
// releases the funds on request of the Union Cabinet, which later gets an approval from
// Parliament. A Parliament approval is mandatory.
// ● Public Account: Public Account of India accounts for flows for those transactions where the
// Government is merely acting as a banker. This fund was constituted under Article 266 (2) of
// the Constitution. It accounts for flows for those transactions where the government is merely
// acting as a banker. Examples of those are provident funds, small savings and so on. These

// Q10. Consider the following:
// 1. Right to education
// 2. Right to equal access to public service
// 3. Right to food
// Which of the above is/are Human Right/Human Rights under “Universal Declaration of Human Rights”?
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 1 and 2 only
// (c) 3 only
// (d) 1, 2 and 3
// Answer: (d)
// On 10 December 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations announced the Universal Declaration
// of Human Rights (UDHR) - 30 rights and freedoms of all human beings.
// Statement 1 is correct: Article 26 of UDHR states that everyone has the right to education. Education shall
// be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages.
// Statement 2 is Correct: Article 21 of UDHR states that everyone has the right of equal access to public
// service in the country.
// Statement 3 is correct: Article 25 of UDHR states that everyone has the right to a standard of living
// adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and

// sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.
// Environment and Geography
// Q1. Biodiversity forms the basis for human existence in the following ways:
// 1. Soil formation
// 2. Prevention of soil erosion
// 3. Recycling of waste
// 4. Pollination of crops
// Select the correct answer using the code given below:
// (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
// (b) 2, 3, and 4 only
// (c) 1 and 4 only
// (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
// Answer: (d)
// Statement 1 is correct: Biodiversity helps in the maintenance and formation of soil structure and the
// retention of moisture and nutrient levels. Clearing of vegetation has contributed to the leaching of
// nutrients, salinisation of soils, lateralization of minerals and accelerated erosion of topsoil, reducing
// the land's productivity. On the other hand, Trees lower the water table and remove deposited salt
// from the upper soil horizons.
// Statement 2 is correct: The relationship between erosion and biodiversity is reciprocal. Soil organisms
// can both reduce soil loss, by improving porosity, and increase it, by diminishing soil stability as a result
// of their mixing activities.
// Statement 3 is correct: Deforestation due to raw materials destroys the natural habitat and causes
// global warming. Recycling reduces the need for raw materials and hence preserves the rainforests.
// Statement 4 is correct: Insects are responsible for the pollination of 3/4th of all the plants cultivated
// for human consumption. Bees, which are severely endangered by human activities such as excessive
// pesticide and land use, would heavily impact human beings when they die out.
// Q2. Which one of the following is not a site for in-situ method of conservation of flora?
// (a) Biosphere Reserve
// (b) Botanical Garden
// (c) National Park
// (d) Wildlife Sanctuary
// Answer: (b)
// Option (b) is not correct: Botanical Garden is not a site for 'in-situ' method of conservation of flora.
// In-situ conservation is on site conservation or the conservation of genetic resources in natural
// populations of plant or animal species, such as forest genetic resources in natural populations of tree
// species.
// Q3. Consider the following:
// 1. Carbon dioxide
// 2. Oxides of nitrogen
// 3. Oxides of Sulphur
// Which of the above is/are the emission/emissions from coal combustion at thermal power
// plants?
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 2 and 3 only
// (c) 1 and 3 only
// (d) 1, 2, and 3
// Answer: (d)
// More than 70% of total energy consumed in India is shared by thermal power producing energy from
// coal, gas and diesel which constitute 69.52% of the installed capacity of India. India’s Total 80% coal
// produced is consumed by coal-based power plants only and despite that we need to continuously
// import coal.
// Option (d) is correct: The main emissions from coal combustion at thermal power plants are carbon
// dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), carbonaceous
// material, and air-borne inorganic particles such as fly ash, also known as suspended particulate matter
// (SPM) and other trace gas species. Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons are
// greenhouse gases.
// Q4. The formation of ozone holes in the Antarctic Region has been a cause of concern. What could
// be the reason for the formation of this hole?
// (a) Presence of prominent tropospheric turbulence; and inflow of chlorofluorocarbons
// (b) Presence of prominent polar front and stratospheric clouds; and inflow of
// chlorofluorocarbons
// (c) Absence of polar front and stratospheric clouds; and inflow of methane and
// chlorofluorocarbons
// (d) Increased temperature at polar region due to global warming
// Answer: (b)
// Ozone layer depletion is the gradual thinning of the earth’s ozone layer in the upper atmosphere
// caused due to the release of chemical compounds containing gaseous bromine or chlorine from
// industries or other human activities.
// ● Ozone depletion occurs when ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere are destroyed by
// chemical reactions with halogen gases, such as chlorine. To form chlorine the nitric acid in
// polar stratospheric clouds reacts with chlorofluorocarbon carbon (CFCs), which catalyses the
// photochemical destruction of ozone. In the winter months Cold conditions above Antarctica
// encourage the formation of extremely cold, high-altitude clouds. [Option (b) is correct]
// Q5. Two important rivers- one with its source in Jharkhand (and known by a different name in
// Odisha), and another, with its source in Odisha- merge at a place only a short distance from the
// coast of Bay of Bengal before flowing into the sea. This is an important site of wildlife and
// biodiversity and a protected area. Which one of the following could be this?
// (a) Bhitarkanika
// (b) Chandipur-on-sea
// (c) Gopalpur-on-sea
// (d) Simlipal
// Answer: (a)
// Option (a) is correct: Bhitarkanika, a storehouse of nature's bounty, harbours a rich and unique
// biodiversity. This unique ecosystem of Orissa is surrounded by rivers Baitarani, Brahmani, Dhamara,
// and is crisscrossed by several creeks-creeklets. Geographically situated in Kendrapara district,
// Bhitarkanika forms the deltaic region of the river Brahmani and Baitarani. Bhitarkanika is home to
// the largest population of saltwater crocodile, water monitor lizard, king cobra, python and many
// other reptiles and amphibians besides herbivores
// Bhitarkanika National Park is situated in Kendrapara district, which is about 162 km from
// Bhubaneswar, the state capital. The Park encompasses an area of 672 km².
// Q6. Regarding “carbon credits’’, which one of the following statements is not correct?
// (a) The carbon credit system was ratified in conjunction with the Kyoto protocol.
// (b) Carbon credits are awarded to countries or groups that have reduced greenhouse gases
// below their emission quota.
// (c) The goal of the carbon credit system is to limit the increase of carbon dioxide emission.
// (d) Carbon credits are traded at a price fixed from time to time by the United Nations
// environment programs.
// Answer: (d)
// A carbon credit is a tradable permit or certificate that provides the holder of the credit the right to
// emit one ton of carbon dioxide or an equivalent of another greenhouse gas – it is essentially an offset
// for producers of such gases.
// Option (d) is not correct: Carbon credit prices are never fixed because they are traded on an exchange.
// It is a permit that allows the company that holds it to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other
// greenhouse gases. One credit permits the emission of a mass equal to one ton of carbon dioxide.
// Credit is one half of a so-called "cap-and-trade" program.
// Q7. There is a concern over the increase in harmful algal blooms in the seawater of India. What
// could be the causative factors for this phenomenon?
// 1. Discharge of nutrients from the estuaries.
// 2. Run-off from the land during the monsoon.
// 3. Upwelling in the seas.
// Select the correct answer from the code given below:
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 1 and 2 only
// (c) 2 and 3 only
// (d) 1, 2 and 3
// Answer: (d)
// Statement 1 is correct: Algal blooms are the result of an excess of nutrients, particularly some
// phosphates. Algal blooms are caused by a major influx of nutrient-rich runoff into a water body,
// programs to treat wastewater, reduce the overuse of fertilizers in agriculture and reducing the bulk
// flow of runoff can be effective for reducing severe algal blooms at river mouths, estuaries, and the
// ocean directly in front of the river's mouth.
// Statement 2 is correct: Monsoon and Climate Change might affect rainfall patterns, leading to
// alternating periods of drought and intense storms. This can cause more nutrient runoff into water
// bodies, feeding more algal blooms.
// Statement 3 is correct: The process by which winds push surface water offshore and deep water
// moves towards the coast, bringing nutrients from the ocean floor to the surface is Coastal upwelling.
// Climate change is expected to alter the timing and intensity of coastal upwelling. Along the East and
// west coast of India, excess nutrients delivered by upwelling might lead to more algal blooms.
// Q8. Consider the following:
// 1. Photosynthesis
// 2. Respiration
// 3. Decay of organic matter
// 4. Volcanic action
// Which of the above add carbon dioxide to the carbon cycle on earth?
// (a) 1 and 4 only
// (b) 2 and 3 only
// (c) 2, 3 and 4 only
// (d) 1, 2 ,3 and 4
// Answer: (c)
// Option (c) is correct: Carbon cycle is the process where carbon compounds are interchanged among
// the biosphere, geosphere, pedosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the earth. Respiration,
// decay of organic matter, volcanic action, add carbon dioxide to the carbon cycle on earth.
// ● Carbon enters the atmosphere as CO2. CO2 is absorbed by autotrophs such as green plants.
// Animals consume plants, thereby, incorporating carbon into their system. Animals and plants
// die, their bodies decompose, and carbon is reabsorbed back into the atmosphere.
// ● The Carbon Cycle is an important aspect of the survival of all life on earth. From an
// environmental perspective, carbon provides insulation by trapping the sun’s heat. From a
// biological perspective, carbon is the building block of life and forms stable bonds with other
// elements necessary for life.
// Q9. A sandy and saline area is the natural habitat of an Indian animal species. The animal has no
// predators in that area, but its existence is threatened due to the destruction of its habitat. Which
// one of the following could be that animal?
// (a) Indian wild buffalo
// (b) Indian wild ass
// (c) Indian wild boar
// (d) Indian gazelle
// Answer: (b)
// Option (b) is correct: The Indian wild ass (Equus hemionus khur) also known as Ghor Khar or Ghud
// Khur is found in the Little Rann of Kutch and its surrounding areas in Gujarat. Its preferred
// environment are Saline deserts (Rann), arid grasslands and shrublands. It is also found in Afghanistan,
// southern Pakistan, and south-eastern Iran.
// ● Indian wild buffalo: Terai region
// ● Indian wild boar: Tt can survive in different types of habitats: grasslands, taiga, tropical
// rainforests, but they prefer life in deciduous forests.
// ● Chinkara (Indian gazelle): Thar desert
// Q10. With reference to micro-irrigation, which of the following statements is/are correct?
// 1. Fertilizer/nutrient loss can be reduced.
// 2. It is the only means of irrigation in dry land farming.
// 3. In some areas of farming, receding of the groundwater table can be checked.
// Select the correct answer using the code given below:
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 2 and 3 only
// (c) 1 and 3 only
// (d) 1, 2 and 3
// Answer: (c)
// Micro-irrigation is the process of slow application of water to the soil so that moisture is retained in
// the upper layer rather than percolating underground or causing surface run-off.
// Statement 1 is correct: Micro-irrigation can increase yields and decrease water, fertiliser, and labour
// requirements. Using Micro-irrigation fertilizer or nutrient loss can be reduced as less water is applied
// hence fertilizers are easily absorbed into plants.
// ● Moreover, by applying water directly to the root zone, the practice reduces loss of water
// through conveyance, run-off, deep percolation, and evaporation.
// Statement 2 is not correct: It is not the only means of irrigation in dry land farming. Micro Irrigation
// can be applied to any form of land because it saves water in Irrigation.
// Statement 3 is correct: Agriculture consumes the largest share of groundwater in India - the biggest
// user of groundwater in the world. The past few decades have witnessed an alarming depletion of
// groundwater resources in the country.
// ● While almost half of the agricultural area cultivating food grains in India depends on irrigation,
// as high as 65 percent of these irrigated land holdings depend on groundwater to meet their
// water needs. It has been recommended that farmers should move from flood irrigation to drip
// or sprinkler irrigation systems (micro- irrigation).
// ● This will help in conserving groundwater as well as save on the cost of irrigation. Using such
// micro-irrigation systems has also been linked to an increase in the yield of crops.
// Q11. The 2004 Tsunami made people realize that mangroves can serve as a reliable safety hedge
// against coastal calamities. How do mangroves function as a safety hedge?
// (a) The mangrove swamps separate the human settlements from the sea by a wide zone in which
// people neither live nor venture out.
// (b) The mangroves provide both food and medicines which people are in need of after any natural
// disaster.
// (c) The mangrove trees are tall with dense canopies and serve as an excellent shelter during a
// cyclone or Tsunami.
// (d) The mangrove trees do not get uprooted by storms and tides because of their extensive roots.
// Answer: (d)
// Mangroves are shrubs or small trees that grow in coastal saline or brackish water. Mangroves are salttolerant trees, also called halophytes, and are adapted to harsh coastal conditions. Mangrove
// vegetation facilitates more water loss.
// Option (d) is correct: Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems, and the trees may vary in height
// from 8 to 20 m. They protect the shoreline from the effect of cyclones and tsunamis. It is due to the
// fact that mangrove trees do not get uprooted by storms and tides because of their extreme roots.
// Mangrove belts and their extensive roots several hundred meters wide have been shown to reduce
// tsunami height by between 5 and 30%. Wider mangrove forests are more effective at reducing
// tsunami height, as well as speed of the water and the area flooded by the tsunami.
// Q12. The “Red Data Books’’ published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and
// Natural Resources (IUCN) contain lists of
// 1. Endemic plant and animal species present in the biodiversity hotspots.
// 2. Threatened plant and animal species.
// 3. Protected sites for conservation of nature and natural resources in various countries.
// Select the correct answer using the code given below:
// (a) 1 and 3 only
// (b) 2 only
// (c) 2 and 3 only
// (d) 3 only
// Answer: (b)
// Option (b) is correct: “Red Books”, a public document which is created for recording endangered
// threatened and rare species of plants, animals, fungi as well as some local subspecies which are
// present in a particular region is considered as a Red Data Book.
// ● It gives complete information about research, studies and, also for monitoring of the programs
// on rare and endangered species and their habitats. It is mainly created to identify and protect
// those species which are on the verge of extinction.
// Q13. Three of the following criteria have contributed to the recognition of western Ghats, Sri Lanka
// and Indo-Burma regions as hotspots of biodiversity:
// 1. Species richness
// 2. Vegetation density
// 3. Endemism
// 4. Ethno-botanical importance
// 5. Threat perception
// 6. Adaptation of flora and fauna to warm and humid conditions
// Which three of the above are correct criteria in this context?
// (a) 1, 2 and 6 only
// (b) 2, 4 and 6 only
// (c) 1, 3 and 5 only
// (d) 3, 4 and 6 only
// Answer: (c)
// Option (c) is correct: The term “Biodiversity hotspots” Coined by Norman Myers can be defined as
// the regions which are known for their high species richness, thread perception and endemism. In
// 1989 and 1996, Conservation International (CI) adopted Myers’ hotspots as its institutional blueprint
// and the organization made the decision to undertake a reassessment of the hotspots concept.
// India is known for its rich biodiversity and has 23.39% of the geographical area covered by forests and
// trees.
// Biodiversity hotspot in India:
// ● Himalaya: Includes the entire Indian Himalayan region (and that falling in Pakistan, Tibet,
// Nepal, Bhutan, China and Myanmar).
// ● Indo-Burma: Includes entire North-eastern India, except Assam and Andaman group of Islands
// (and Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and southern China).
// ● Sundalands: Includes Nicobar group of Islands (and Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei,
// Philippines).
// ● Western Ghats and Sri Lanka: Includes entire Western Ghats (and Sri Lanka).
// Q14. In the context of ecosystem productivity, marine upwelling zones are important as they
// increase marine productivity by bringing the:
// 1. Decomposer microorganisms to the surface
// 2. Nutrients to the surface
// 3. Bottom-dwelling organisms to the surface
// Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
// (a) 1 and 2 only
// (b) 2 only
// (c) 2 and 3 only
// (d) 3 only
// Answer: (b)
// Statement 1 and statement 3 are not correct: Microorganisms are natural decomposers as they
// possess an enormous ability to utilize diverse types of organic substances as a source of energy and
// convert toxic ones into harmless by-products. They do not have any relevance in the context of
// ecosystem productivity. Organisms and decomposer microorganisms would remain where they are,
// no movement to the surface can be noticed at the upwelling zone.
// Statement 2 is correct: Upwelling is an oceanographic phenomenon that involves wind-driven motion
// of dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface, replacing the warmer,
// usually nutrient-depleted surface water. The increased availability in upwelling regions results in high
// levels of primary productivity and thus fishery production. Approximately 25% of the total global
// marine fish catches come from five upwellings that occupy only 5% of the total ocean area.
// Q15. If a tropical rainforest is removed, it does not regenerate quickly as compared to a tropical
// deciduous forest. This is because
// (a) The soil of the rainforest is deficient in nutrients.
// (b) Propagules of the trees in a rainforest have poor viability.
// (c) The rain forest species are slow growing.
// (d) Exotic species invade the fertile soil of the rainforest.
// Answer: (a)
// Option (a) is correct: The soil of the rainforest is deficient in nutrients. Here rainforest means Rainfall
// throughout the year. It rains almost every day during this the topsoil is continuously washed away
// this may result in nutrients being washed away.
// ● It will start leaching of nutrients and very little fertility remains in topsoil. In this case most
// of the seeds don’t germinate for years.
// ● The Regeneration Process will be very slow (it may take decades). But the layer below topsoil
// (subsoil) is very fertile. So, plants grow very quickly once their roots reach the sub-soil and if
// they receive enough sunlight.
// Q16. The Himalayan Range is very rich in species diversity. Which one among the following is the
// most appropriate reason for this phenomenon?
// (a) It has a high rainfall that supports luxuriant vegetative growth.
// (b) It is a confluence of different biogeographical zones.
// (c) Exotic and invasive species have not been invasive species and have not been introduced in
// this region.
// (d) It has less human interference.
// Answer: (b)
// The Himalayas have three biogeographical zones which have different biodiversity as: Northwest
// Himalayas, West Himalayas, Central Himalayas, and East Himalayas, which together constitute about
// 6.4% of the country's area. It is a confluence of different biogeographical zones due to which the
// Himalayan region is very rich in species diversity.
// Q17. Consider the following statements:
// 1. Biodiversity is normally greater in the lower latitudes as compared to the higher latitudes.
// 2. Along the mountain gradients, biodiversity is normally greater in the lower altitudes as
// compared to the higher altitudes.
// Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 2 only
// (c) Both 1 and 2
// (d) Neither 1 nor 2
// Answer: (c)
// Statement 1 is correct: Latitudinal gradients of biodiversity are biogeographic patterns that quantify
// the ways in which taxonomic, phylogenetic, functional, genetic, or phonetic biodiversity change with
// the latitudinal position on the surface of the earth. Species richness, or biodiversity, increases from
// the poles to the tropics. So, the latitude range with maximum species diversity is the equator region
// which is at lower latitude.
// Statement 2 is correct: Decrease in species diversity takes place from lower to higher altitude on
// mountains. On Mountain Higher seasonal variations and fall in temperature leads to reduction in
// biodiversity with 1000 m increase in altitude leads to temperature drop of about 6.5°C.
// Q18. Among the following states, which one has the most suitable climatic conditions for the
// cultivation of a large variety of orchids with minimum cost of production, and can develop an
// export-oriented industry in this field?
// (a) Andhra Pradesh
// (b) Arunachal Pradesh
// (c) Madhya Pradesh
// (d) Uttar Pradesh
// Answer: (b)
// Option (b) is correct: There are more than 1,300 species of orchids found in India, primarily in the
// Northeast: Assam, Meghalaya, and Arunachal Pradesh and also in Sikkim and south India. Most
// orchids are perennial herbs with simple leaves and if raised in the right conditions (temperature not
// less than 16-17oC), they should last eight weeks with flowers, after which the blooms slowly start
// dropping off. Among all the states, Arunachal Pradesh has the most suitable climatic conditions for
// the cultivation of a large variety of orchids with minimum cost of production and can develop an
// export-oriented industry in this field.
// Q19. La Nina is suspected to have caused recent floods in Australia. How is La Nina different from EI
// Nino?
// 1. La Nina is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperature in the equatorial Indian ocean
// whereas EI Nino is characterized by unusually warm ocean temperature in the equatorial
// Pacific Ocean.
// 2. EI Nino has an adverse effect on the southwest monsoon of India, but La Nina has no effect on
// monsoon climate.
// Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 2 only
// (c) Both 1 and 2
// (d) Neither 1 nor 2
// Answer: (d)
// Statement 1 is not correct: La Nina is a cold event. Here, the water temperature in the Eastern Pacific
// gets colder than normal. As a result of this, there is a strong high pressure over the eastern equatorial
// Pacific. Now, there is low pressure in the Western Pacific and off Asia. La Nina causes drought in Peru
// and Ecuador, heavy floods in Australia, high temperatures in Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, off the
// Somalian coast and good monsoon rains in India. A La Nina is actually beneficial for the Indian
// monsoon.
// Statement 2 is not correct: Since 1950, out of the 13 droughts that India faced, 10 have been during
// El Nino years and one in a La Nina year. El Nino means lesser than average rains for India. Indian
// agriculture is heavily dependent on the monsoons and because of this, lesser rainfall during the
// monsoons generally translates to below-average crop yields.
// Q20. What is the difference between asteroids and comets?
// 1. Asteroids are small rocky planetoids, while comets are formed of frozen gases held together
// by rocky and metallic material.
// 2. Asteroids are found mostly between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars, while comets are found
// mostly between Venus and mercury.
// 3. Comets show a perceptible glowing tail, while asteroids do not.
// Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
// (a) 1 and 2 only
// (b) 1 and 3 only
// (c) 3 only
// (d) 1, 2 and 3
// Answer: (b)
// Statement 1 is correct: Comets are made up mostly of frozen gases and mass of dust. The surface is
// icy and as the comet approaches the sun, the ice vaporizes. That make-up distinguishes comets from
// asteroids because asteroids, on the other hand, are made up of rocky and metallic material. Asteroids
// are warmer since they are much closer to the sun.
// Statement 2 is not correct: Asteroids and Comets are considered as near-earth objects (NEO). They
// can be visible and there is always a possibility of earth collision but still, the chances are very, very
// slim. Both asteroids and comets orbit around the sun. However, comets tend to have an extremely
// elongated movement around the sun while asteroids have more circular orbits and most of them are
// found in the asteroid belt where they orbit the sun between the planets Mars and Jupiter.
// Statement 3 is correct: Comets have a distinct characteristic of forming a visible coma and at times, a
// long tail of ions pointing opposite the sun which the asteroid does not have. This is because of the
// comet's icy surface but far away from the sun, it is hard to distinguish a comet from an asteroid.
// Q21. Westerlies in the southern hemisphere are stronger and persistent than in the northern
// hemisphere. Why?
// 1. Southern Hemisphere has less landmass as compared to the Northern Hemisphere.
// 2. Coriolis force is higher in the Southern Hemisphere as compared to the Northern Hemisphere.
// Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 2 only
// (c) Both 1 and 2
// (d) Neither 1 nor 2
// Answer: (a)
// The westerly winds, also known as the westerlies, occur at two regions on Earth: between 30 and 60
// degrees latitude in the Northern Hemisphere and between 30 and 60 degrees latitude in the Southern
// Hemisphere. The name of these unique winds comes from the direction of their origin; the westerlies
// run west to east while other winds run east to west.
// Statement 1 is correct: In the Southern Hemisphere, westerlies are particularly strong, especially in
// areas where land is absent, because land amplifies the flow pattern, making the current more northsouth oriented, slowing the westerlies.
// Statement 2 is not correct: Coriolis force is strongest in the polar regions and zero at the equator. At
// the intermediate levels it varies directly as the sine of the latitude.
// Q22. Between India and East Asia, the navigation time and distance can be greatly reduced by which
// of the following?
// 1. Deepening the Malacca straits between Malaysia and Indonesia.
// 2. Opening a new canal across the Kra Isthmus between the Gulf of Siam and Andaman Sea.

// (c) Both 1 and 2
// (d) Neither 1 nor 2
// Answer: (b)
// Statement 1 is not correct: Malacca strait is “linked” to its economic importance rather than “time of
// navigation and distance”. The deepening of the strait would certainly help in Increasing the volume
// of the business because ships of larger sizes can pass through it, there is no significance of distance
// and navigation.
// Statement 2 is correct: Kra isthmus canal, also known as Kra canal, a proposed canal that would
// connect the Gulf of Thailand with the Andaman Sea across the Kra Isthmus in southern Thailand. It is
// envisaged that such a canal would improve transportation in the region, similar to the Panama Canal
// and Suez Canal. The canal would provide an alternative to transit through the Straits of Malacca.
// Opening Kra isthmus canal will greatly reduce navigation time and distance between India and EastAsia.
// Q23. The lower Gangetic plain is characterized by a humid climate with high temperature
// throughout the year. Which one among the following pairs of crops is most suitable for this region?
// (a) Paddy and cotton
// (b) Wheat and Jute
// (c) Paddy and Jute
// (d) Wheat and cotton
// Answer: (c)
// Option (c) is correct: The low and deltaic plains of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers that are
// characterized by humid climate with high temperature throughout the year. Paddy and Jute is the
// most suitable crops for this region.
// ● Paddy is the first-ranking crop in the vast region stretching from lower Gangetic Plain to
// Brahmaputra Valley in the east and the circum-coastal alluvial tracts of the Peninsula
// region. Paddy cultivation has a complete dominance over all fertile plains around Bay of
// Bengal.
// Q24. What could be the main reason/reasons for the formation of African and Eurasian desert belts?
// 1. It is located in the subtropical high-pressure cells.
// 2. It is under the influence of warm ocean currents.
// Which of the statements given above is/are correct in this context?
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 2 only
// (c) Both 1 and 2
// (d) Neither 1 nor 2
// Answer: (a)
// Statement 1 is correct: The desert occurs in two broad belts viz. at 20-30° north and south of the
// Equator along the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. At the equator hot air would rise and spread north
// and south before cooling and it would condense and release its moisture over the tropical zones
// leading to development of an equatorial zone of low atmospheric pressure. The two tropical zones
// are at high pressure and nearer to the poles are two low-pressure belts of cold. As the denser air sinks
// towards the ground to the two subtropical high-pressure belts, wind is created which is hot and
// completely lacking in moisture. This blows across the Middle East, the Sahara, and North America.
// Statement 2 is not correct: Eurasian Belt is related to cold currents not warm current.
// Q25. The jet aircrafts fly very easily and smoothly in the lower stratosphere. What could be the
// appropriate explanation?
// 1. There are no clouds or water vapour in the lower stratosphere.
// 2. There are no vertical winds in the lower stratosphere.
// Which of the statements given above is/are correct in this context?
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 2 only
// (c) Both 1 and 2
// (d) Neither 1 nor 2
// Answer: (c)
// Statement 1 is correct: The amount of water vapour in the stratosphere is very low, only 5 out of one
// million air molecules are water molecules. This means that under normal conditions there are no
// clouds in the stratosphere. Clouds are found almost exclusively in the troposphere.
// Statement 2 is correct: As one moves upward through the stratosphere Temperatures rise opposite
// of the behaviour in the troposphere in which we live, where temperatures drop with increasing
// altitude. Because of this temperature stratification, there is little convection and mixing in the
// stratosphere, so the layers of air there are quite stable. Jet aircraft fly in the lower stratosphere to
// avoid the turbulence which is common in the troposphere below.
// Q26. The Brahmaputra, Irrawaddy and Mekong Rivers originate in Tibet's narrow and
// parallel mountain ranges in their upper reaches. Of these rivers, Brahmaputra makes a “U” turn in
// its course to flow into India. This “U” turn is due to
// (a) Uplift of folded Himalayan series
// (b) Syntaxial bending of geologically young Himalayas
// (c) Geo-tectonic disturbance in the tertiary folded mountain chains
// (d) Both (a) and (b) above
// Answer: (b)
// Brahmaputra River has its source in southwest Tibet. It flows there with the name Tsangpo River
// (flowing from the crest/ summit). The river runs across south Tibet to penetrate the Himalayan
// Mountain Ranges in huge canyons and subsequently into Arunachal Pradesh (India). In Arunachal
// Pradesh, it is called Dihang. The river runs to the southwest across the Assam Basin as Brahmaputra
// and towards the south through Bangladesh as the Jamuna (you should not confuse it with Yamuna of
// India).
// Option (b) is correct: Brahmaputra makes ‘U’ turn in its course to flow into India near Namcha Barwa
// and it is due to Syntaxial bending of geologically young Himalayas.
// Additional Information:
// ● The gently arching ranges of the Himalayan mountains on their Western and Eastern
// extremities are sharply bent southward in deep Knee-bend flexures that are called syntaxial
// bends.
// ● On both the ends, the great mountains appear to bend around a pivotal point. The western
// point is situated south of the Pamir where the Karakoram meets the Hindu Kush.
// ● A similar sharp, almost hairpin bend occurs on the eastern limit of Arunachal Pradesh where
// the strike of the mountain changes sharply from the Easterly to Southerly trend. Besides these
// two major bends, there are a number of minor syntaxial bends in other parts of Himalayas.
// Q27. A state in India has the following characteristics:
// 1. Its northern part is arid and semi-arid.
// 2. Its central part produces cotton.
// 3. Cultivation of cash crops is predominant over food crops.
// Which one of the following states has all of the above characteristics?
// (a) Andhra Pradesh
// (b) Gujarat
// (c) Karnataka
// (d) Tamil Nadu
// Answer: (b)
// Statement 1 is correct: The northern arid regions in India comprised largely the desert of Rajasthan,
// the Rann of Kutch and the semi-arid regions of Punjab and Gujarat. The Southern arid regions are in
// the rain shadow of the Western Ghats covering states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
// Statement 2 is correct: India is the country to grow all four species of cotton. Gossypium Hirsutum
// represents 88% of the hybrid cotton production in India and all the current BT cotton hybrids are
// Gossypium Hirsutum. In India, majority of the cotton production comes from nine major cotton
// growing states, which are grouped into three diverse agro-ecological zones, as under:
// ● Northern Zone: Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan
// ● Central Zone: Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh
// ● Southern Zone: Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka
// Statement 3 is correct: The economy of Gujarat is largely dependent upon agriculture. More than 50
// percent of the total available production is cash crop. The main food crops are bajra, jowar, rice and
// wheat. Major commercial crops or cash crops are groundnut, tobacco and cotton, linseed, sugarcane,
// etc. Gujarat is the state where cultivation of cash crops is predominant over food crops.

// Q1. The Jain philosophy holds that the world is created and maintained by
// (a) Universal Law
// (b) Universal Truth
// (c) Universal Faith
// (d) Universal Soul
// Answer: (a)
// Jainism lays emphasis on non-violence (ahimsa). Followers of Jainism follow a very strict and welldisciplined life. The first Tirthankar, Rishabhdev, flourished before the Indus Valley Civilization and is
// referred to as Lord Vishnu in the Puranas and is also mentioned in the Vedas.
// Option (a) is correct: Jainism does not support belief in a creator deity. According to the Jain Doctrine,
// the universe and its constituents have always existed, and their actions are governed by Universal
// Natural Laws. The world, according to the Jain Doctrine is not created, maintained or destroyed by
// any deity but functions according to Universal Law.
// Q2. Regarding the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:
// 1. It was predominantly a secular civilization and the religious element, though present, did not
// dominate the scene.
// 2. During this period, cotton was used for manufacturing textiles in India.
// Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 2 only
// (c) Both 1 and 2
// (d) Neither 1 nor 2
// Answer: (c)
// Statement 1 is correct: Indus Valley Civilization was highly developed, and it must have taken
// thousands of years to reach that stage. It was a predominantly a secular civilization and even though
// religious elements were present, it did not dominate the scene.
// Statement 2 is correct: The economy of the Indus Valley Civilization depended upon crops and animal
// husbandry. The main crops grown were rice, wheat, melons, dates, vegetables, mainly legumes and
// cotton. Large granaries were also found. Cotton later became the stimulus for the growth of the textile
// Industry.
// Q3. The “dharma” and “rita” depict a central idea of ancient Vedic civilization of India. In this
// context, consider the following statements:
// 1. Dharma was a conception of obligations and of the discharge of one’s duties to oneself and to
// others.
// 2. Rita was the fundamental moral law governing the functioning of the universe and all it
// contained.
// Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 2 only
// (c) Both 1 and 2
// (d) Neither 1 nor 2
// Answer: (c)
// Statement 1 is correct: Dharma means law or natural law and it is a concept of importance in Indian
// religion and philosophy. In Hindu context, it refers to a person’s personal obligation or duties. A
// Hindu’s Dharma is affected by his age, class, caste, gender and occupation. Dharma is usually defined
// as “righteousness” or “duty”. The four aims of a man’s life are
// ● Kama (gratification of desire)
// ● Artha (acquirement of wealth)
// ● Dharma (discharge of duty)
// ● Moksha (final emancipation)
// Statement 2 is correct: Rita is the physical order of the universe, the order of the sacrifice and moral
// law of the world. According to Vedic Religion, Rita was guarded by Varuna, the god-sovereign, who
// was assisted by Mitra, the god of honour and proper performance of sacrifices was necessary to
// guarantee its continuance. Violation (anrita) of the order was considered sin and required careful
// expiation.
// Q4. India maintained its early cultural contacts and trade links with Southeast Asia across the Bay
// of Bengal. For this pre-eminence of early maritime history of Bay of Bengal, which of the following
// could be the most convincing explanation/explanations?
// (a) As compared to other countries, India had better ship-building technology in ancient and
// medieval times.
// (b) The rulers of southern India always patronized traders, brahmin priests and Buddhist monks
// in this context.
// (c) Monsoon winds across the Bay of Bengal facilitated sea voyages.
// (d) Both (a) and (b) are convincing explanations in this context.
// Answer: (c)
// Option (c) is correct: Monsoon plays a predominant role in the daily life of the people of South Asia.
// The use of monsoon wind in the Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal, and the Arabian Sea for maritime
// trade was a boon to the sailing ships to reach overseas countries. It is believed that Hippalus
// discovered monsoon wind in AD 45-47. Before the discovery of monsoon wind, the mariners of
// Odisha, India set their journey to Southeast Asian countries during the northeast monsoon (trade
// wind) and return during the Southwest monsoon. Monsoon winds across the Bay of Bengal facilitated
// sea voyages. The flow of wind and current was favourable for setting sail for both onward and return
// journeys. Similarly, during the historical period, the Arabs sailed in the Indian Ocean with the help of
// monsoon wind and the Europeans, particularly the Portuguese sailed their vessels in such a manner
// that they could reach the shores of India before the Southwest monsoon and return only after the
// beginning of Northeast monsoon.
// Q5. The tendency for increased litigation was visible after the introduction of the land settlement
// system of Lord Cornwallis in 1793. The reason for this is normally traced to which of the following
// provisions?
// (a) Making Zamindar’s position stronger vis-a-vis the ryot
// (b) Making East India Company an overlord of Zamindars
// (c) Making judicial system more efficient
// (d) None of the (a), (b) and (c) above
// Answer: (d)
// Option (d) is correct: The main features of the land settlement system of Lord Cornwallis were as
// under:
// ● The Zamindars who collected land revenues were made owners of the land.
// ● The Zamindars had to pay a fixed amount to the company.
// ● It was decided that the Government would claim 10/11 of the gross revenue.
// ● In case, any Zamindar failed to pay the fixed amount of revenue, the government had the right
// to confiscate some part of his land holding to recover the amount due.
// ● The farmers or the ryots were made the tenants of the Zamindars.
// ● The Zamindars were deprived of their administrative and judicial powers.
// ● The government assured that it would not interfere with the traditions of the Zamindars
// Cornwallis abolished the court fees which affected the earnings of the company and resulted in a
// massive increase in the number of cases. Abolition of Court fees encouraged litigation without any
// restraint.
// Q6. Which one of the following observations is not true about the Quit India Movement of 1942?
// (a) It was a nonviolent movement
// (b) It was led by Mahatma Gandhi
// (c) It was a spontaneous movement
// (d) It did not attract the labour class in general
// Answer: (b)
// Mahatma Gandhi raised the slogan of ‘do or die’ at the Bombay session of the All India Congress
// Committee, thereby initiating India into the mass uprising that would eventually lead to the nation’s
// freedom. Gandhi had been striving for self-determination of Indians at different levels for the last
// several decades. However, the significance of the ‘Quit India Movement’ lay in the broadening of his
// support base to include peasants, students, and the lower middle class.
// ● Following Gandhi’s call for civil disobedience on August 8, 1942, the Mahatma along with all
// the leaders were imprisoned, leaving the movement leaderless. In the absence of any
// organised structure, people engaged in the most daring and spontaneous acts of protest
// against British rule. [Option (b) is not correct]
// ● Railway lines were disrupted, police stations were burnt down, and telegraph services
// destroyed. The British retaliated in vehement terms using ‘lathi charges’ and making mass
// arrests.
// ● An aspect of the movement that is rarely spoken about is the way it encouraged women to
// come out of the thresholds of their homes and raise their voice against British rule. With the
// majority of the men behind bars, women took to the streets, raising slogans, holding public
// lectures and demonstrations, and even making and transporting explosives.
// Q7. With reference to the period of colonial rule in India, “Home Charges” formed an important part
// of the drain of wealth from India. Which of the following funds constituted “Home Charges”?
// 1. Funds used to support the India Office in London.
// 2. Funds used to pay salaries and pensions of British personnel engaged in India.
// 3. Funds used for waging wars outside India by the British.
// Select the correct answer using the code given below:
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 1 and 2 only
// (c) 2 and 3 only
// (d) 1, 2 and 3
// Answer: (b)
// During the period of direct British rule from 1858 to 1947, official transfers of funds to the UK by the
// colonial government were called the “Home Charges”. They mainly represented debt service,
// pensions, India Office expenses in the UK, purchases of military items and railway equipment.
// Government procurement of civilian goods, armaments and shipping was carried out almost
// exclusively in the UK. By the 1930s these home charges were in the range of £40 to £50 million a year.
// Some government expenditure was on imports which an independent government would have bought
// from local manufacturers. Of these official payments, we can legitimately consider service charges on
// non-productive debt, pensions, and furlough payments as a balance of payment drain due to
// colonialism.
// Home Charges:
// ● Cost of the Secretary of State’s India Office in London. (Option 1 is correct)
// ● East India Company’s military adventure.
// ● Salaries and pensions to British Indian officials and army officers. (Option 2 is correct)
// ● The compensation of the Company’s shareholders.
// ● Cost of army training.
// ● Transport, equipment, and campaigns outside India.

// (c) Both 1 and 2
// (d) Neither 1 nor 2
// Answer: (a)
// Statement 1 is correct: Due to drought in 1918, the crops failed in Kheda district of Gujarat. According
// to the Revenue Code, if the yield was less than one-fourth of the normal produce, the farmers were
// entitled to remission, however the government refused.
// Statement 2 is not correct: The Gujarat Sabha, consisting of the peasants, submitted petitions to the
// highest governing authorities of the province requesting that the revenue assessment for the year
// 1919 be suspended. The government, however, remained adamant and said that the property of the
// farmers would be seized if the taxes were not paid. Gandhi asked the farmers not to pay the taxes.
// ● It was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and a group of other devoted Gandhians, namely, Narahari
// Parikh, Mohanlal Pandya and Ravi Shankar Vyas, who went around the villages and gave the
// necessary political leadership.
// Q9. What was the purpose with which Sir William Wedderburn and W.S.Caine had set up the Indian

// Answer: (b)
// As an answer to Lord Birkenhead’s challenge, an All-Parties Conference met in February 1928 and
// appointed a sub-committee under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru to draft a constitution. This was
// the first major attempt by the Indians to draft a constitutional framework for the country.
// The Committee included Tej Bahadur Sapru, Subhash Bose, M.S.Aney, Mangal Singh, Ali Imam,
// Shuaib Qureshi and G.R.Pradhan as its members. The report was finalised by August 1928.
// Statement 1 is not correct: In the December 1929 session of the Congress, presided by Jawaharlal
// Nehru, the Congress declared “Purna Swaraj” or Complete independence as its ultimate goal.
// The Nehru Report confined itself to British India, as it envisaged the future link-up of British India with
// the princely states on a federal basis. For the dominion, it recommended:
// ● Dominion status on lines of self-governing dominions as the form of government desired by
// Indians.
// ● Rejection of separate electorates, instead, a demand for joint electorates with reservation of

// Q1. Aspartame is an artificial sweetener sold in the market. It consists of amino acids and provides
// calories like other amino acids. Yet, it is used as a low-calorie sweetening agent in food items. What
// is the basis of this use?
// (a) Aspartame is as sweet as table sugar, but unlike table sugar, it is not readily oxidized in the
// human body due to lack of requisite enzymes.
// (b) When aspartame is used in food processing, the sweet taste remains, but it becomes resistant
// to oxidation.
// (c) Aspartame is as sweet as sugar, but after ingestion into the body, it is converted into
// metabolites that yield no calories.
// (d) Aspartame is several times sweeter than table sugar, hence food items made with small
// quantities of aspartame yield fewer calories on oxidation.
// Answer: (d)
// Option (d) is correct: Aspartame is a low-calorie artificial sweetener used to sweeten a wide variety
// of low- and reduced-calorie foods and beverages. Aspartame is metabolized by the human body into
// two constituent’s methanol and amino acids then hydrolysis products are managed by our body in
// the same way as L-Phenylalanine, aspartic acid, and methanol from other consumed foods. These
// components yield no calories and add nothing new to the diet.
// Q2. What is the difference between a CFL and a LED lamp?
// 1. To produce light, a CFL uses mercury vapour and phosphor while an LED lamp uses
// semiconductor material.

// Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 2 and 3 only
// (c) 1 and 3 only
// (d) 1, 2 and 3
// Answer: (c)
// Compact Fluorescent Light (CFL) is a light bulb which uses fluorescence for producing the light whereas
// the Light Emitting Diode (LED) uses the semiconductor diode for producing visible light.
// Statement 1 is correct: CFL uses mercury vapour and phosphor to produce light while LED lamps use
// semiconductor material. Due to the use of mercury, power consumption in CFL is more (as more
// power is required for ionisation) than LED.
// Statement 2 is not correct: The average lifespan of LED lamps (not CFL) is much longer than that of
// CFL. LEDs are better than CFL in every aspect. LED lamps save power, cost is very less, recyclable and
// lifespan are also higher than CFL lamps.
// Statement 3 is correct: A CFL is less energy efficient as compared to a LED lamp. A CFL can save
// energy cost up to 70% whereas a LED lamp can save energy cost up to 80%.
// Additional Information:
// ● The destruction of CFL bulbs is difficult because it contains toxic mercury vapour. This mercury
// vapour has harmful effects on the health of the human and environment whereas the
// destruction of LEDs is easy because it is free from toxic metals.

// Q7. Microbial fuel cells are considered a source of sustainable energy. Why?
// 1. They use living organisms as catalysts to generate electricity from certain substrates.
// 2. They use a variety of inorganic materials as substrates.
// 3. They can be installed in wastewater treatment plants to cleanse water and produce electricity.
// Which of the following statements given above is/are correct?
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 2 and 3 only
// (c) 1 and 3 only
// (d) 1, 2 and 3
// Answer: (c)
// Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a new bioelectrochemical process that aims to produce electricity by
// using the electrons derived from biochemical reactions catalysed by bacteria.
// Option (c) is correct: Microbial fuel cells are low-power devices that use microbes (single-celled living
// organisms) to convert wastewater into electricity. A huge range of organic compounds can be
// converted into carbon dioxide, water, and energy by a population of bacteria each of which is roughly
// 1 micron in size. Consumption of these compounds is a normal part of the microorganism’s
// metabolism; in a microbial fuel cell part of the energy liberated is harvested in the form of electricity.
// Microbial fuel cells have various practical applications such as in breweries, domestic wastewater
// treatment, desalination plants, hydrogen production, remote sensing, and pollution remediation, and
// they can be used as a remote power source.
// Q8. The surface of a lake is frozen in severe winter, but the water at its bottom is still liquid. What
// is the reason?
// (a) Ice is a bad conductor of heat.
// (b) Since the surface of the lake is at the same temperature as the air, no heat is lost.
// (c) The density of water is maximum at 4°c.
// (d) None of the statements (a), (b) and (c) given is correct.
// Answer: (c)
// Option (c) is correct: The density of water is greatest at 4˚C and in cold weather ice forms at the top
// of the water. But after some time, it acts as an insulating barrier, preventing the water underneath
// from getting much colder. Frozen lake surface acts like an insulator preventing heat from the water
// from escaping, keeping the heat of the water trapped.
// Q9. What is the difference between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices?
// (a) Bluetooth uses 2.4 GHz radio frequency band, whereas Wi-Fi can use 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz
// frequency band.
// (b) Bluetooth is used for wireless local area networks (WLAN) only, whereas Wi-Fi is used for
// wireless wide area networks (WWAN) only.
// (c) When information is transmitted between two devices using blue-tooth technology, the
// devices have to be in the line of sight of each other, but when Wi-Fi technology is used the
// devices need not be in the line of sight of each other.
// (d) The statements (a) and (b) given above are correct in this context.
// Answer: (a)
// Option (a) is correct: Bluetooth uses the microwave radio frequency spectrum in the 2.402 GHz to
// 2.480 GHz range. Wi-Fi is based upon IEEE 802.11 standards that uses 2.4, 3.6 and 5 GHz frequency
// bands. IEEE 802.11 is for implementation of the wireless local area network (WLAN) using the above
// frequencies and makes the basis of Wi-Fi wireless networks.
// Option (b) is not correct: Bluetooth is also used for Personal Area Network (PAN) and not only used
// for wireless local area networks (WLAN). Whereas Wi-Fi is used for local area network (LAN).
// Option (c) is not correct: Wireless communication through Radio Frequency has many advantages as
// it does not require any line of sight connection between the transmitter and receiver while the line of
// sight connection exists in infrared communication. Both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi use radio frequency for
// communication, the connecting devices (whether Bluetooth enabled, or Wi-Fi enabled) do not have
// to be in the line of sight of each other.
// ● Line of sight (LoS) is a type of propagation that can transmit and receive data only where
// transmit and receive stations are in view of each other without any sort of an obstacle
// between them.
// Q10. Salinization occurs when the irrigation water accumulated in the soil evaporates, leaving
// behind salts and minerals. What are the effects of Salinization on irrigated land?
// (a) It greatly increases the crop production
// (b) It makes some soils impermeable
// (c) It raises the water table
// (d) It fills the air spaces in the soil with water
// Answer: (b)
// Option (b) is correct: Salinization makes it more difficult for plants to absorb soil moisture making it
// impermeable. It has detrimental effects on plant growth and yield. Sea levels are rising, which further
// accelerates the process of salinization due to climate change. Vast areas of farmland are lost every
// day due to salinization, land that is desperately needed to feed the world’s growing population.
// Q11. An artificial satellite orbiting around the Earth does not fall down. This is so because the
// attraction of Earth
// (a) does not exist at such a distance.
// (b) is neutralized by the attraction of the moon.
// (c) provides the necessary speed for its steady motion.
// (d) provides the necessary acceleration for its motion.
// Answer: (d)
// An artificial satellite moving around the Earth in a circular orbit possesses an acceleration which is
// “constant” in magnitude but “changing in direction”. An artificial satellite revolves around the earth
// under centripetal acceleration. Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes with time, in terms
// of both speed and direction. An artificial satellite maintains its orbit by balancing two factors: its
// velocity, that is the speed it takes to travel in a straight line and the gravitational pull that Earth has
// on it. An artificial satellite orbiting closer to the Earth requires more velocity to resist the stronger
// gravitational pull.
// Q12. When the bark of a tree is removed in a circular fashion all around near its base, it gradually
// dries up and dies because?
// (a) Water from soil cannot rise to aerial parts.
// (b) Roots are starved of energy.
// (c) Tree is infected by soil microbes.
// (d) Roots do not receive oxygen for respiration.
// Answer: (b)
// Option (b) is correct: The innermost layer of the bark is Phloem, and its main function is to do the
// transport of soluble organic material made during photosynthesis which is called translocation. If
// water or minerals produced in the leaves are not sent to the parts such as roots, they will be starved
// of energy and die.
// Q13. A layer in the Earth’s atmosphere called the ionosphere facilitates radio communication. Why?
// 1. The presence of ozone causes the reflection of radio waves to earth.
// 2. Radio waves have a very long wavelength.
// Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
// (a) 1 only

// Q16. The function of heavy water in a nuclear reactor is to?
// (a) Slow down the speed of neutrons.
// (b) Increase the speed of neutrons.
// (c) Cooldown the reactor.
// (d) Stop the nuclear reaction.
// Answer: (a)
// Option (a) is correct: Nuclear reactors are the heart of a nuclear power plant. They contain and control
// nuclear chain reactions that produce heat through a physical process called fission. That heat is used
// to make steam that spins a turbine to create electricity. In a nuclear reactor heavy water is used to
// slow down the neutrons. A neutron hitting a deuterium nucleus slows down quickly. A neutron
// hitting a deuterium nucleus slows down quickly.
// ● Heavy water is deuterium oxide or D20. The world’s second-largest producer of heavy water
// in India. Heavy water is used as coolant as well as neutron moderator. It is chemically the
// same as normal water (H20) but the hydrogen atoms are of the heavy isotope deuterium in
// which the nucleus contains a neutron in addition to protons found in the nucleus of any
// hydrogen atom.
// Additional Information:
// ● A nuclear reactor is driven by the splitting of atoms, a process called fission, where a particle
// (a ‘neutron’) is fired at an atom, which then fissions into two smaller atoms and some
// additional neutrons. Some of the neutrons that are released then hit other atoms, causing
// them to fission too and release more neutrons. This is called a chain reaction.
// ● The fissioning of atoms in the chain reaction also releases a large amount of energy as heat.
// The generated heat is removed from the reactor by a circulating fluid, typically water. This
// heat can then be used to generate steam, which drives turbines for electricity production.

// (a) O positive
// (b) A positive
// (c) B positive
// (d) Cannot be determined on the basis of the given data
// Answer: (a)
// Option (a) is correct: One of the parent's blood group is AB⁺ to form single chromosome cells his cell
// will undergo division during reproduction either A⁺ cell or B⁺ cell. Other parent has blood group O⁻
// which will remain same during reproduction.
// The following configuration the offspring thus produced may have:
// ● A⁺ and O⁻ results in A⁺
// ● B⁺ and O⁻ results in B⁺
// Their offspring can have only either A⁺ or B⁺ blood groups. So, the adopted son’s blood group will be
// O positive.

// 2. the photosynthesis by phytoplankton in the oceans
// 3. the trapping of air in the polar ice caps
// Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
// (a) 1 and 2 only
// (b) 2 only
// (c) 2 and 3 only
// (d) 3 only
// Answer: (b)
// Option (b) is correct: Phytoplankton is responsible for most of the transfer of carbon dioxide from
// the atmosphere to the ocean. Carbon dioxide is consumed during photosynthesis, and the carbon is
// incorporated in the phytoplankton, just as carbon is stored in the wood and leaves of a tree.
// ● Most of the carbon is returned to near-surface waters when phytoplankton is eaten or
// decompose, but some falls into the ocean depths. Worldwide, this “biological carbon pump”
// transfers about 10 gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere to the deep ocean each year.
// ● Even small changes in the growth of phytoplankton may affect atmospheric carbon dioxide
// concentrations, which would feed back to global surface temperatures.

// (a) Empirical liberalism
// (b) Existentialism
// (c) Darwin's theory of evolution
// (d) Dialectical materialism
// Answer: (d)
// Option (d) is correct: Karl Marx made class struggle the central fact of social evolution. “The history
// of all hitherto existing human society is the history of class struggles.” In Marx’s view, the dialectical
// nature of history is expressed in the class struggle. He called this phenomenon dialectical
// materialism. With the development of capitalism, the class struggle takes an acute form.
// ● Two basic classes, around which other less important classes are grouped, oppose each other
// in the capitalist system: the owners of the means of production, or bourgeoisie, and the
// workers, or proletariat. “The bourgeoisie produces its own grave-diggers. The fall of the
// bourgeoisie and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.”

// Answer: (d)
// Option (d) is correct: Microfinance generally refers to the provision of basic financial services such as
// loans, saving accounts, fund transfers and insurances for low-income but economically active people.
// ● In most instances the term microfinance refers to the provision of small loans (microcredits)
// for micro-entrepreneurs. The idea of microfinance, however, is not new but can be traced
// back to the principle of self-help and solidarity which was devised by savings banks and
// cooperative banking groups.
// ● Around two thirds of the world population is cut off from the conventional financial market.
// Low-income people typically have no collateral and therefore no chance to take out a loan, to
// save money or to invest for the future.
// ● Women especially are often considered as not credit-worthy by banks. Microfinance came as
// a boon for the financially vulnerable and left out populations of the society.

// (a) 1 only
// (b) 1 and 3 only
// (c) 3 only
// (d) 1, 2 and 3
// Answer: (b)
// Option (b) is correct: The Look East policy emerged as an important foreign policy initiative of India in
// the post-Cold War period. It was launched in 1991 by the Narasimha Rao government with the aim
// of developing political contacts, increasing economic integration, and forging security cooperation
// with countries of Southeast Asia. The policy marked a shift in India’s perspective of the world, with

// Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
// (a) 1 only
// (b) 2 only
// (c) Both 1 and 2
// (d) Neither 1 nor 2
// Answer: (d)
// Statement 1 is not correct: The Australia Group (AG), on the other hand, is an informal forum of
// countries which, through the harmonisation of export controls, seeks to ensure that exports do not
// contribute to the development of chemical or biological weapons.
// ● The Wassenaar Arrangement, formally established in July 1996, is a voluntary export control
// regime whose 42 members exchange information on transfers of conventional weapons and
// dual-use goods and technologies. Through such exchanges, Wassenaar aims to promote
// "greater responsibility" among its members in exports of weapons and dual-use goods and to
// prevent "destabilizing accumulations." It is not formal group under the OECD
// ● Unlike its predecessor, the Cold War-era Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export
// Controls (COCOM), which was created to restrict exports to the former Soviet Union and
// Eastern bloc, Wassenaar is not targeted at any region or group of states, but rather at "states

// Statement 2 is not correct: In the Australia Group, there are not many Asian and African countries.
// Only India (joined in 2018) and Japan (Joined in 1985) are the Asian countries in the Australia Group
// and there is not a single African country in that group. The Wassenaar agreement has South Africa,

// Q13. Which amongst the following provided a common factor for tribal insurrection in India in the
// 19th century?
// (a) Introduction of a new system of land revenue and taxation- of tribal products
// (b) Influence of foreign religious missionaries in tribal areas
// (c) Rise of a large number of money lenders, traders and revenue farmers as middlemen in tribal
// areas
// (d) The complete disruption of the old agrarian order of the tribal communities
// Answer: (d)
// Option (d) is correct: The main cause of tribal insurrection was the rapid changes that British
// introduced in the economy, administration, and land revenue system. These changes led to the
// disruption of the old agrarian order of the tribal communities causing prolonged and widespread
// suffering among tribal communities. Also, increasing demands for land revenue and extracting as
// large an amount as possible by British government proved to be devastating for Indian villages,
// throwing millions on the verge of impoverishment. British government encroached upon the
// traditional tribal land rendering tribals in a condition of destitution in their own land.
// Q14. Regular intake of fresh fruits and vegetables is recommended in the diet since they are a good
// source of antioxidants. How do antioxidants help a person maintain health and promote longevity?
// (a) They activate the enzyme necessary for vitamin synthesis in the body and help prevent vitamin
// deficiency.
// (b) They prevent excessive oxidation of carbohydrates, fats and protein in the body and help
// avoid unnecessary wastage of energy.
// (c) They neutralize the free radical produced in the body during metabolism.
// (d) They activate certain genes in the cells of the body and help delay the ageing process.
// Answer: (c)
// Antioxidants are man-made or natural substances that may prevent some types of cell damage. Diets
// high in vegetables and fruits, which are good sources of antioxidants, have been found to be healthy.
// Examples of antioxidants include vitamins (C and E), and minerals (copper, zinc, selenium, etc.)
// Option (c) is correct: Antioxidants are molecules that fight free radicals in our body. Free radicals are
// compounds that can cause harm if their levels become too high in our body. They are linked to multiple
// illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Our body has its own antioxidant defences to
// keep free radicals in check. Antioxidants are also found in food, especially in fruits, vegetables, and
// other plant-based, whole foods, which may prevent some of the damage caused by free radicals by
// neutralising them. Antioxidant preservatives also play a crucial role in food production by increasing
// shelf life.
// Free Radicals:
// ● Free radicals are constantly being formed in your body. Without antioxidants, free radicals
// would cause serious harm very quickly, eventually resulting in death.
// ● However, free radicals also serve important functions that are essential for health. For
// example, our immune cells use free radicals to fight infections. As a result, your body needs
// to maintain a certain balance of free radicals and antioxidants.
// ● When free radicals outnumber antioxidants, it can lead to a state called oxidative stress.
// Prolonged oxidative stress can damage your DNA and other important molecules in your body.
// Sometimes it even leads to cell death.
// ● Several lifestyle, stress, and environmental factors are known to promote excessive free
// radical formation and oxidative stress, including air pollution, cigarette smoke, alcohol intake,
// toxins, etc.`;
